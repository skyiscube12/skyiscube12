- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @skyiscube12
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things motorsport, coding (even tho I'm very beginner) and performance analysis 
Looking to learn Python to begin with, but hoping my knowledge and commitment will lead me to learn more about data analysis and how to arrange for racing drivers and engineers to better understand it
